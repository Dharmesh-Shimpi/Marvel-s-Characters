# Marvel-s-Characters

For some reason the deployed is not working.  Please run the folder in a personal IDE it will work, it takes somes time to load but it will load given that it fetchs 100 characters at 1 time and I just learnt this so I don't know how to make it faster without using any other frameworks.
